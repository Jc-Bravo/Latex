\section*{Step 1}
let educated people go where they want to go; it is suitable for both people and the country they belong to.

\section*{Step 2 : benefits}
\begin{itemize}
  \item migrants repay by remitted; some are huge.
  \item help well-educated emigrants find jobs

  \item can give developing countries an incentive to invest in education.

  \item can affect the home country directly by shaping the regulatory structure of the home country's venture-capital
  

\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 3 }
I think this argument is vital in using data rather than subjective assumptions, such as the remitted, which use the exact number of the remitted of \$325 in 2010, and the more than 20\%GDP. Their number shows 
the thing in the true in the world. But I also think there is a weak place as to how the migration decamping to Silicon Valley, Which causes the 
loss of the home country, will do the wrong thing to the home country. If there is evidence that can compare the loss of migration and the repayment, the statistics will be better.
