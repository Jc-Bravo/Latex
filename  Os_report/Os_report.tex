\part*{Chapter 1 Operatings system interfaces}
\section*{preface}
The job of an operating system is to share a computer among multiple programs and to provide a more useful set of services than the hardware alone supports.And provides services to user programs through an interface\\
\subsection*{What is a good interface :} provides services to user programs through an interface;offer many powerful features to applications\\
\textbf{xv6:}mimicking Unix's internal design\\
knrnel:a special program that provides services to running programs\\
program(called a process):has memory containing instructions, data, and a stack\\
instructions:implement the program’s computation\\
data:variables on which the computation acts\\
stack:organizes the program’s procedure calls

shell:an ordinary program that reads commands 
from the user and executes them.
The fact that the shell is a user program, 
and not part of the kernel
